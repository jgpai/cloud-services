_(a.k.a. the “Don’t Blame Us” Clause)_

Welcome, brave explorer of the [Bitol API](https://bitol.io/)!

By using this service, you acknowledge and agree that:

🧪 This is an experimental and educational platform — think of it as a playground, not a fortress.

⛔ There are no guarantees of uptime, accuracy, performance, or even common sense.

🕵️‍♂️ Confidentiality is not guaranteed. Don’t put secrets here. Seriously. No passwords, no trade secrets, no unicorn DNA.

📉 We are not responsible for any data loss, broken code, career setbacks, or spontaneous combustion of servers.

🎯 Use this at your own risk — preferably with your test environment, not production.

If all of this sounds acceptable (or at least entertaining), proceed and enjoy responsibly. 🍷
